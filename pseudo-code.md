# Create html with a basic scene for Menu maybe, with a button to start the game, and a score menu.
Import Three.js module, gltf loader, orbit controls, etc.

# Create the canva and scene objects (scene, camera, light, renderer, event listeners, 3D models)
Choosing classes and inheritance or namespace to put all the functions and variables?

# Create the shape of pieces 
Using sprites or 2D array, or 3D box geometries?

# Create the board (Grid?!)
2D grid with or box geometries?

# Create the gameplay logic (keyboard input, movement, collision detection, scoring, etc.)
This needs to be seen how to implement it.
